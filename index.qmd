# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Version control is a somewhat large topic and the git, github, github cli and github pages technologies can be daunting.
However, users can go a long way with a minimal set of commands.

It is true that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, but it probably isn't quite as bad as complete ignorance.

*Starting with git, github and github pages* aims to provide a minimal knowledge base, sufficient to get you started without having to wade through reams of documentation.
It can be browsed online or downloaded as a word document for your reference.
