# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The topic of version control is quite broad and ranging.
Additionally, the git, github, github cli and github pages etc version control technologies can be daunting for newcomers to set up and apply.
However, once you have things installed (and configured) and you have a basic grip on how it all fits together at a high level, then you can go a long way with some introductory knowledge.

I know, it is true that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, but it probably isn't quite as bad as complete ignorance.

This text, **Get going with git**, aims to provide introductory knowledge that is sufficient to get you up and running with git as a means for version control.
The primary focus is on developing knowledge on a core set of functionalities.

The text can be browsed online or downloaded as a word document for your reference and will be used as a companion for a training workshop.
