# Introduction {.unnumbered}

When you are getting into the nitty gritty, version control is a large topic.
The git, github, github cli and github pages ... technologies can be daunting to set up and use.
However, once you have things installed and configured and you understand how things fit together at a high level, then you can go a long way with a minimal set of commands.

I know, it is true that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, but it probably isn't quite as bad as complete ignorance.

**Get going with git** - aims to provide a minimal knowledge base, sufficient to get you started with the core functionality and hopefully without having to wade through reams of documentation that is distributed all over the internet.

It can be browsed online or downloaded as a word document for your reference.
