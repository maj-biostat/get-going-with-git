# Introduction {.unnumbered}

When you are getting into the nitty gritty, version control is a large topic.
The git, github, github cli and github pages ... technologies can be daunting to set up and use.
However, once you are setup properly and understand how things fit together at a high level, users can go a long way with a minimal set of commands.

I know, it is true that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, but it probably isn't quite as bad as complete ignorance.

**Get going with git** - aims to provide a minimal knowledge base, sufficient to get you started without having to wade through reams of documentation distributed all over the internet.
It can be browsed online or downloaded as a word document for your reference.
