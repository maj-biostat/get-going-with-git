## Diff tools {#sec-diff-tools}

Instead of parsing the online diff, you can opt to configure a specialised difftool.
[Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) is one such example.
The documentation is good so I will not rehash it here.
I mostly use the command line and if necessary GitHub, so I cannot really comment on how good Delta is.
