<!-- git remote add origin https://github.com/career-karma-tutorials/ck-git gh repo create my-newrepo –public –source=. –remote=upstream –push -->

<!-- The first part of the one liner: gh repo create my-newrepo creates and names a repo in your account (note: ‘my-newrepo’ should be replaced by the repo name of your choice) The -public flag makes sure the repo is public (swap this for -private if necessary) The -source=. flag specifies the source directory to be pushed Finally, the -remote=upstream flag specifies the remote repository to which the local repository is going to be compared with when pushing i.e the ‘upstream’ default. -->
