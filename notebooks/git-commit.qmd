## Adding files to projects

Let's start to introduce files for the project.
Open a text editor, enter the following contents:

```{md}
# my-first-repo

This is a readme.md file that captures important information about the project.

The project is only a demo.
```

save the file as `readme.md` in the `my-first-repo` directory.


Create a new file as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
cat("Enter a string please: ");
a <- readLines("stdin",n=1);
cat("You entered")
str(a);
cat( "\n" )
```

save the file as `hello.R` in the `my-first-repo` directory.
Or, download these files - [hello.R](https://github.com/maj-biostat/get-going-with-git/resources/my-first-repo/hello.R) [readme.md](https://github.com/maj-biostat/get-going-with-git/resources/my-first-repo/readme.md).

Now from the terminal in the `my-first-repo` director, type:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git status
## On branch main
## 
## No commits yet
## 
## Untracked files:
##   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
## 	readme.md
## 
## nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Referencing the figure shown in @sec-repo-struct we now have added a file to the working directory.
The files is presently untracked.

## Commit process

Next, we want to add the new file to the repository.
