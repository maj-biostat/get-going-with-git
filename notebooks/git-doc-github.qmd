## Overleaf

If you are a Latex fan then [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) (depending on the version you have) provides some integration with GitHub.

For now, I am just providing a link to the [instructions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/GitHub_Synchronization) to set this up.
I have used it in the past and it works OK, but I think that GitHub pages and Quarto provides a better alternative for project documentation.
