Inevitably there are some installation tasks that we need to take care of before we proceed.

::: callout-warning
The following steps can be a bit of a pain.
Don't be disheartened, it gets less tiresome.

## RStudio

Developers - is your instance of RStudio up to date?
If not, update it.
Ditto for R.
Keep them both updated.

## Install git 

I am going to break this down into Mac and Windows because they are the two systems that most of AHI seem to use and the installation is somewhat different for each.
If you are using Linux, you probably have no need to be reading this.

### Mac OSX

First, do you have git installed already?
Launch the `terminal` app (see the pre-requisites on the landing page if you do not know how to do this).
In the terminal, type:

```
which git
```

which should show the location of the version of git in use:

```
## /opt/homebrew/bin/git
```

If you have homebrew (see below) installed, you can just type:

```
brew install git
```

and git will be installed, otherwise, follow the instructions below and then come back here.

Once git is installed run the `which git` command again and then run `git --version` which is shown (along with the output) below:

```
git --version
## git version 2.42.0
```

If you got here, then you have git installed.
You can close down terminal, open it up again and then run the `git --version` command again to make certain that everything is ok.

### Homebrew

In the previous section, you can see that the path output from the `which git` command includes `homebrew`.
For macOS, `homebrew` is a package manager.
This basically just lets you install and manage packages (applications) on your mac.

To use homebrew, you need to install it first.
To do that, go [here](https://brew.sh/), then follow the instructions, which amount to going to the terminal and running the commands listed below.

Please go and read the landing page for homebrew before you proceed any further.

The first command ensures that pre-requisites are met, see [here](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation):

```
 xcode-select --install
```

if this has already been doing you will get an error, or be asked to run Software Update.
Generally, you can just move on to the next command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

`curl` is a tool for transferring data from a url.
It is usually stored under `/usr/bin` but if you are having issues then exporting the following might assist:

```
export HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL=1
```

which basically tells homebrew to use its own version of curl.
After the above is complete, homebrew should be installed.
Now you can run 

```
brew install git
```

to install git for you.

For reference, here are a minimal set of commands for using homebrew (additional information can be found in the homebrew man pages).

Basic information on homebrew:

```
# Display the version of Homebrew.
$ brew --version
# Print Help Information
$ brew help
# Print Help Info for a brew command
$ brew help <sub-command>
# Check system for potential problems.
$ brew doctor
```

Keep your homebrew applications up to date:

```
# Fetch latest version of homebrew and formula
$ brew update
# Show formulae with an updated version available
$ brew outdated
# Upgrade all outdated and unpinned brews
$ brew upgrade
# Upgrade only the specified brew
$ brew upgrade <formula>
# Prevent the specified formulae from being upgraded
$ brew pin <formula>
# Allow the specified formulae to be upgraded.
$ brew unpin <formula>
```

The core commands for managing commandline applications are:

```
# List all the installed formulae.
$ brew list
# Display all locally available formulae for brewing.
$ brew search
# Perform a substring search of formulae names for brewing.
$ brew search <text>
# Display information about the formula.
$ brew info <formula>
# Install the formula.
$ brew install <formula>
# Uninstall the formula.
$ brew uninstall <formula>
# Remove older versions of installed formulae.
$ brew cleanup
```

Homebrew casks allow you to install GUI applications.
Unless you are an advanced user, you will rarely need to use these, but for completeness:

```
# Tap the Cask repository from Github.
$ brew tap homebrew/cask
# List all the installed casks .
$ brew cask list
# Search all known casks based on the substring text.
$ brew search <text>
# Install the given cask.
$ brew cask install <cask>
# Reinstalls the given Cask
$ brew cask reinstall <cask>
# Uninstall the given cask.
$ brew cask uninstall <cask>
```

### Windows {#sec-git-install-win}

The official site for the git windows binary download is [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

Download the 64-bit standalone installer, run it, agree to the conditions and license, choose the default location.

Ensure that the following install components are chosen:

+ windows explorer integration
+ large file support

and accept any other defaults.

With the exception of the following, for any of the other prompts, just accept the defaults. 

1. You will need to nominate a text file editor for editing commit messages and so on.
Unless, you know what you are doing, I would advise just select the Windows Notepad application, you can reconfigure this later if you want to.
2. You should select to override the default branch name as `main`.
The reason to do this is so that git aligns with github (which uses `main` as its default branch).
3. For adjusting the PATH environment variable, ensure that you select `Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software` which is the default.
4. Ensure that line ending conversion is set to `Checkout as-is, commit as-is`. 
5. For the terminal emulator, select `Use Windows default console window`. 
This has some limitations but it is ok for an introduction.
6. Ensure that `Git Credential Manager Core` is selected when prompted.

We will run through this install for someone in the group.

To keep git up to date, you will need to go to the above site and download and reinstall git.

Open the command prompt and type:

```
git --version
## git version 2.42.0
```
