## Git repositories

A repository is the most basic component of git. 
It is where you store your files and each files history.
Repositories can be public or private, can have multiple collaborators and can be stored locally (on your personal computer) or remotely (in the cloud hosted by a service provider like github).

Using git, you can create and configure repositories, add or remove files and review history of the files in the repository.

### Initialisation

There are two basic ways of creating a repository on your local machine

1. Initialise a new repository
2. Clone an existing repository

We will look at initialising a new repository, cloning will come later.
Run the following on your machine

```
cd ~
```
