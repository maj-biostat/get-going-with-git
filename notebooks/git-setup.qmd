## Configuration for git

Per the sentiment of Fred Basset, you are now up but not quite running.

One of the first things we need to do is to set a username and email address: 

```{bash, eval = F, engine = "sh"}
git config --global user.name "Fred"
git config --global user.email "fred.basset@comic-land.com"
```

You can list your configuration with

```{bash, eval = F, engine = "sh"}
git config --global --list
```

We will get into the why later, but basically any interaction you have with git will be tied to your username and email address.
This has obvious benefits if we want to be able to figure out who has done what, when and why.

Another tweak we will make is to the default branch name.
Git always used to use `master` by default.
GitHub, in its infinite wisdom, appeared to make some judgement on the connotations of that default and so changed it to `main`.
This piece of config just makes Git consistent with GitHub.

```{bash, eval = F, engine = "sh"}
git config --global init.defaultBranch "main"
```
