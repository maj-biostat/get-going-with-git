## GitHub account {#sec-github-setup}

As noted in the pre-requisites for using this knowledge base, you will need to have [GitHub](www.github.com) account.

The two ways to interact with GitHub are HTTPS and SSH.
They are both secure protocols with the goal of protecting your credentials and your work.
SSH can be a little harder to set up and has some advantages over HTTPS, but it also less commonly used and can be problematic when firewalls are involved so we will stick to HTTPS.

But first we need to set up a Personal access token.

### Personal access token

GitHub introduced personal access tokens a short while ago.
Personal access tokens are basically a password with some bells and whistles.

1. Login to your GitHub account.
2. Open [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) in a new tab in your browser and follow the instructions.
3. Set the expiry to at least several months into the future.


## Git Credential manager

While SSH uses keys (along with a key agent) HTTPS relies on you having a mechanism to retain your credentials.
Neither having to type in your personal access token each time you want to push a change to a remote repository or retaining your credentials within the git config are viable nor recommended approaches.

Enter the Git Credential Manager (GCM).
The [GCM](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/blob/main/README.md) is a platform agnostic credential manager (in English, that translates loosely to a *password manager*).
Once it's installed and configured, Git Credential Manager is called by git and you shouldn't need to do anything special.

The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires authentication, Git will prompt you to log in using a browser window. 
You may first be asked to authorize an OAuth app. 
If your account or organization requires two-factor auth, you'll also need to complete the 2FA challenge.

Once you've authenticated successfully, your credentials are stored in the macOS keychain and will be used every time you clone an HTTPS URL. 
Git will not require you to type your credentials in the command line again unless you change your credentials.


### GCM install

For Windows users it can be installed by selecting this option during the installation wizard, see @sec-git-install-win, step 6.

For macOS, use `homebrew` again, specifically:

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
brew install --cask git-credential-manager

```

### GCM demo

Below I demo the process by cloning a private repository from my GitHub account.

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
192-168-1-100:tmp mark$ git clone https://github.com/maj-biostat/wisca_2.git
Cloning into 'wisca_2'...
info: please complete authentication in your browser...
```

at this point the following window is launch by GCM:

![GCM](../fig/gcm-login.png){width=50%}

selecting `Sign in with your browser` the following will launch in your default browser (Chrome, Safari, etc)

![Sign in with browser](../fig/gcm-signin-browser.png){width=50%}

selecting `Authorize git-ecosystem` will result in 

![Sign in with browser](../fig/gcm-auth-code.png){width=50%}

at which point you use the 2-factor authenticator tool (I use google authenticator) to respond with an authentication code.

![Auth success](../fig/gcm-auth-success.png){width=50%}

Looking back at the terminal, the following output can be observed, which details the repository being cloned.

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
remote: Enumerating objects: 297, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (297/297), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (156/156), done.
remote: Total 297 (delta 148), reused 284 (delta 137), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (297/297), 7.85 MiB | 2.13 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (148/148), done.
```

Finally, you will receive an email of this sort:

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
Hey maj-biostat!

A first-party GitHub OAuth application (Git Credential Manager) with gist, repo, and workflow scopes was recently authorized to access your account.
Visit https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/0120e057bd645470c1ed for more information.

To see this and other security events for your account, visit https://github.com/settings/security-log

If you run into problems, please contact support by visiting https://github.com/contact

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
```

On repeating this process a second time, all the authentication works in the background and there will be no need to go through various authentication handshakes again.

The same process applies irrespective of whether you are using [GitHub.com](https://github.com) or the [USyd GitHub Enterprise Server](https://github.sydney.edu.au).
However, it is adviseable to get this working in GitHub first and then work on getting it to work in the USyd GitHub Enterprise Server.

The transition from the old authentication approach has (so far) proved completely seemless for macOS.
It will be interesting to see what happens for the Windows platform.


### GCM configuration (advanced only)

You can view the current credential manager by running the following commands:

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
git config --local credential.helper
git config --global credential.helper
# /usr/local/share/gcm-core/git-credential-manager
git config --system credential.helper
```

Of the local, global and system, the first one checks the local repository config, the second is your ~/.gitconfig, and the third is based on where git is installed. 
Note that only one credential help is configured in the above example.

In some circumstances you may need to reconfigure things.
If you have to start from scratch, the following may be useful:

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
git config --local --unset credential.helper
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --system --unset credential.helper
```

For windows uses check the contents of the credential manager.
This can be accessed via Control Panel >> All Control Panel Items >> Credential Manager or by simply typing Credential Manager in the Windows task bar.
Under generic credentials you should see the git entries.


## GitHub CLI

In the day to day grind, having to deal with GitHub through its Web interface can be a little cumbersome.
You can obviate having to interact with GitHub through the browser by using the [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli).
This tooling allows you to review, create and manage your repositories from the comfort of your commandline.
You can think of it as an extension of git that allows you to invoke the GitHub specific functionality.

The extremely term gh CLI manual can be found [here](https://cli.github.com/manual/).

For Windows users, you can pick up the latest Signed MSI executables from the [release page](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/).

For macOS, use `homebrew`:

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
brew install gh

```

### GitHub CLI authentication

In order to make use of `gh` we need to go through another round of authentication setup.
To do this, go to the terminal and run:

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
gh auth login
## ? What account do you want to log into? GitHub Enterprise Server
## ? GHE hostname: github.sydney.edu.au
## ? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS
## ? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes
## ? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser
```

For additional information, see [gh auth --help](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth).

In order to use `gh` with github.com directly you need to authenticate for that platform too.
Repeat the above, but now the responses look like this:

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
gh auth login
## ? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
## ? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS
## ? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes
## ? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser
```

You are nearly set.
You can verify that what you have configured worked via:

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
gh auth status
## github.sydney.edu.au
##   ✓ Logged in to github.sydney.edu.au as mjon7053 (keyring)
##   ✓ Git operations for github.sydney.edu.au configured to use https protocol.
##   ✓ Token: gho_************************************
##   ✓ Token scopes: gist, read:org, repo, workflow
## 
## github.com
##   ✓ Logged in to github.com as maj-biostat (keyring)
##   ✓ Git operations for github.com configured to use https protocol.
##   ✓ Token: gho_************************************
##   ✓ Token scopes: gist, read:org, repo, workflow
```

However, for `gh` to work with the desired host you need to set an environment variable to tell `gh` which platform to use.
On macOS, you can set this up easily with the following entries in the `.profile` shell initialisation script (or `.bash_profile` for those inclined).

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
gh-ent() {
  export GH_HOST=github.sydney.edu.au
}

gh-std() {
  export GH_HOST=github.com
}
```

On Windows, I have no idea how you are supposed to do the above in an easy manner.
You may just have to resort to running

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
set GH_HOST=github.sydney.edu.au
```

or 

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
set GH_HOST=github.com
```

each time you want to switch.

Now (on macOS) when you want to interrogate github.com repositories we can use the following commands.

:::callout-note
Do not worry about the meaning of the commands, this is just to establish that we have configured things correctly.

```{bash, eval = FALSE, engine = "sh"}
gh-std
gh repo list
