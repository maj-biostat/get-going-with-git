# Notation {.unnumbered}

## Code snippets {.unnumbered}

A lot of the code snippets relate to commands being executed at the terminal/commandline.
These look like this:

```
which git
```

and will print a message of some description to the screen, like this:

```
/opt/homebrew/bin/git
```

To differentiate between commands and output, I will prefix the output with a double hash, like this:

```
## /opt/homebrew/bin/git
```
