Now we will make a start with git.
Initially we will focus on using git within the confines of your local machine.
Yes, that's right, we won't be using GitHub until the very end of this part.
The point of this is to give you a chance to get to grips with the basic ideas.
After the main concepts are bedded in, we will move to thinking about GitHub, which is a whole new beast.

We will talk about;

+ Repositories, concepts and how to set them up and configure.
+ How to interact with repositories on a basic level.
+ How to compare and assess the present state of our repository
+ Branches, what they are and what the are used for as well as setting them up
+ Merging, what it is and how to do it
