# Pre-requisites {.unnumbered}

## Background reading

There is no point reinventing the wheel, Jenny Bryant motivates the use of version control in the following paper: [Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928?needAccess=true)

## Command line interface

If you do not know how to operate a terminal, then you need to address that.

### Windows

You can do these tutorials to familiarise yourselves:

+ [How to use Windows 10's Command Prompt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF2q81CxYFI)
+ [Learning Windows Terminal](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-windows-terminal/windows-terminal?u=2196204)

The following link needs admin rights (TKI people probably won't have nor will be able to obtain these rights) and is not strictly necessary here, but it gives a lot of useful commands and an opportunity to gain a bit more familiarity with the commandline.

### macOS

+ [How To Use Terminal On Your Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfT8OfMpARM)
+ [What Is the Mac Terminal?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ExRnh2cRs)
+ [Absolute BEGINNER Guide to the Mac OS Terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKRYQsKR46I)

## System management

You will need to have some minimal technical competence in driving your computer.
At a minimum, you need to know how to set an environment variable under your operating system of choice.
If you do not know how to set an environment variable, then you need to address that.

Other items that are important to be familiar with are file and directory concepts.
For example, if you do not know what the command `tree` does, then it would be useful to find out.
Similarly, if you do not know what file permissions are then, again, it would be useful to find out.

### Windows

You can do these tutorials to familiarise yourselves:

+ [Environment Variables : Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z84UIZy_qgE)
+ [How to Set Environment Variables in Windows 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow2jROvxyH4)

you should be able to set a user variable even if you do not have admin priviledges.

### macOS

+ [How to Set Environment Variables in MacOS](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/set-environment-variable-mac)
+ [PATH Variable (Mac)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J58Pc2ZOAQ)
+ [Use environment variables in Terminal on Mac
