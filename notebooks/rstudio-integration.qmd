When you create a new project in RStudio, you are given the option to create a git repository.
This appear to effectively just run `git init` after creating the default project files.

If you select to create a git repository or open an exisiting project where you have initialised a git repository independently, then the user interface will have a series of new panels.
These new panels comprise a git client (they are entirely dependent on git being installed on your machine).
However, they give you an easy alternative to using the command line interface.
The concepts that we have introduced here are directly transferable to the RStudio context.
