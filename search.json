However, once you are setup properly and understand how things fit together at a high level, users can go a long way with a minimal set of commands.\nI know, it is true that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, but it probably isn’t quite as bad as complete ignorance.\nGet going with git - aims to provide a minimal knowledge base, sufficient to get you started without having to wade through reams of documentation distributed all over the internet. It can be browsed online or downloaded as a word document for your reference.\nWhat is version control? Setting up git Time to commit: working with a local repository Push and pull: working with a remote repository Making your first repository on GitHub Day 2: Collaborating with Others\nDealing with (git) conflicts Branching for sanity Creating pull requests Collaborating with GitHub tools Day 3: Dealing with Complications\nUndoing changes Learning good repository organization principles Ignoring things (in git) Working with large files Using the README Creating GitHub templates Extending git and GitHub with other tools"

You enter in commands as text and the system will do something, e.g. delete a file.\nCLIs are software that are supplied with the operating system. Software that implements such a text interface is often called a command-line interpreter, command processor or a shell.\nNearly universally, if I use the word terminal I am referring to the operating system command line interface.\nWindows refers to its CLI as the command prompt, and in macOS we have the terminal.\nIf you do not know how to operate your operating system CLI then you need to address that.\n\nWindows\nYou can do these tutorials to familiarise yourselves:\n\nHow to use Windows 10’s Command Prompt\nLearning Windows Terminal\n\nThe following link needs admin rights (TKI people probably won’t have nor will be able to obtain these rights) and is not strictly necessary here, but it gives a lot of useful commands and an opportunity to gain a bit more familiarity with the commandline.\n\n40 Windows Commands you NEED to know\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\nHow To Use Terminal On Your Mac\nWhat Is the Mac Terminal?\nAbsolute BEGINNER Guide to the Mac OS Terminal\n\n\n\nExtra credit\n\nLearn the command line"

Remote repositories are hosted by service providers, the most common being GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. We only deal with GitHub here. GitHub comes in a few varieties:\n\nGitHub Enterprise is hosted by the company called GitHub, see github.com. It is a commercial platform, but parts of it are made freely available.\nGitHub Enterprise Server is self-hosted; this is what USyd provides via https://github.sydney.edu.au/\n\nIn a nutshell, git provides a set of commands that allow you to manage the files that are retained in these local and remote repositories.\nAgain, I cannot sum it up better than Jenny, so please take the time to read it.\nExcuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?"

If you are using Linux, you probably have no need to be reading this.\n\n2.2.1 Mac OSX\nFirst, do you have git installed already? Launch the terminal app (see the pre-requisites on the landing page if you do not know how to do this). In the terminal, type:\nwhich git\nwhich should show the location of the version of git in use:\n## /opt/homebrew/bin/git\nIf you have homebrew (see below) installed, you can just type:\nbrew install git\nand git will be installed, otherwise, follow the instructions below and then come back here.\nOnce git is installed run the which git command again and then run git --version which is shown (along with the output) below:\ngit --version\n## git version 2.42.0\nIf you got here, then you have git installed. You can close down terminal, open it up again and then run the git --version command again to make certain that everything is ok.\n\n\n2.2.2 Homebrew\nIn the previous section, you can see that the path output from the which git command includes homebrew. For macOS, homebrew is a package manager. This basically just lets you install and manage packages (applications) on your mac.\nTo use homebrew, you need to install it first. To do that, go here, then follow the instructions, which amount to going to the terminal and running the commands listed below.\nPlease go and read the landing page for homebrew before you proceed any further.\nThe first command ensures that pre-requisites are met, see here:\n xcode-select --install\nif this has already been doing you will get an error, or be asked to run Software Update. Generally, you can just move on to the next command:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\ncurl is a tool for transferring data from a url. It is usually stored under /usr/bin but if you are having issues then exporting the following might assist:\nexport HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL=1\nwhich basically tells homebrew to use its own version of curl. After the above is complete, homebrew should be installed. Now you can run\nbrew install git\nto install git for you.\nFor reference, here are a minimal set of commands for using homebrew (additional information can be found in the homebrew man pages).\nBasic information on homebrew:\n# Display the version of Homebrew.\n$ brew --version\n# Print Help Information\n$ brew help\n# Print Help Info for a brew command\n$ brew help &lt;sub-command&gt;\n# Check system for potential problems.\n$ brew doctor\nKeep your homebrew applications up to date:\n# Fetch latest version of homebrew and formula\n$ brew update\n# Show formulae with an updated version available\n$ brew outdated\n# Upgrade all outdated and unpinned brews\n$ brew upgrade\n# Upgrade only the specified brew\n$ brew upgrade &lt;formula&gt;\n# Prevent the specified formulae from being upgraded\n$ brew pin &lt;formula&gt;\n# Allow the specified formulae to be upgraded.\n$ brew unpin &lt;formula&gt;\nThe core commands for managing commandline applications are:\n# List all the installed formulae.\n$ brew list\n# Display all locally available formulae for brewing.\n$ brew search\n# Perform a substring search of formulae names for brewing.\n$ brew search &lt;text&gt;\n# Display information about the formula.\n$ brew info &lt;formula&gt;\n# Install the formula.\n$ brew install &lt;formula&gt;\n# Uninstall the formula.\n$ brew uninstall &lt;formula&gt;\n# Remove older versions of installed formulae.\n$ brew cleanup\nHomebrew casks allow you to install GUI applications. Unless you are an advanced user, you will rarely need to use these, but for completeness:\n# Tap the Cask repository from Github.\n$ brew tap homebrew/cask\n# List all the installed casks .\n$ brew cask list\n# Search all known casks based on the substring text.\n$ brew search &lt;text&gt;\n# Install the given cask.\n$ brew cask install &lt;cask&gt;\n# Reinstalls the given Cask\n$ brew cask reinstall &lt;cask&gt;\n# Uninstall the given cask.\n$ brew cask uninstall &lt;cask&gt;\n\n\n2.2.3 Windows\nThe official site for the git windows binary download is https://git-scm.com/download/win.\nDownload the 64-bit standalone installer, run it, agree to the conditions and license, choose the default location.\nEnsure that the following install components are chosen:\n\nwindows explorer integration\nlarge file support\n\nand accept any other defaults.\nWith the exception of the following, for any of the other prompts, just accept the defaults.\n\nYou will need to nominate a text file editor for editing commit messages and so on. Unless, you know what you are doing, I would advise just select the Windows Notepad application, you can reconfigure this later if you want to.\nYou should select to override the default branch name as main. The reason to do this is so that git aligns with github (which uses main as its default branch).\nFor adjusting the PATH environment variable, ensure that you select Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software which is the default.\nEnsure that line ending conversion is set to Checkout as-is, commit as-is.\nFor the terminal emulator, select Use Windows default console window. This has some limitations but it is ok for an introduction.\nEnsure that Git Credential Manager Core is selected when prompted.\n\nWe will run through this install for someone in the group.\nTo keep git up to date, you will need to go to the above site and download and reinstall git.\nOpen the command prompt and type:\ngit --version\n## git version 2.42.0"

Note that only one credential help is configured in the above example.\nIn some circumstances you may need to reconfigure things. If you have to start from scratch, the following may be useful:\ngit config --local --unset credential.helper\ngit config --global --unset credential.helper\ngit config --system --unset credential.helper\nFor windows uses check the contents of the credential manager.

    "text": "5.1 Git repositories\nA repository is the most basic component of git. It is where you store your files and each files history. Repositories can be public or private, can have multiple collaborators and can be stored locally (on your personal computer) or remotely (in the cloud hosted by a service provider like github).\nUsing git, you can create and configure repositories, add or remove files and review history of the files in the repository.\n\n5.1.1 Initialisation\nThere are two basic ways of creating a repository on your local machine\n\nInitialise a new repository\nClone an existing repository\n\nWe will look at initialising a new repository, cloning will come later. Run the following on your machine\n# Change dir to the local workshop directory\nmkdir my-first-repo\ncd my-first-repo\ngit init\n## Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/mark/Documents/project/misc-stats/my-first-repo/.git/\ngit status\n## On branch main\n## \n## No commits yet\n## \n## nothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\nIf you received the output detailed above then congratulations, you initialised a git repository.\nIf you have configured your file explorer to show hidden files, you will notice that the my-first-repo directory now contains a .git sub-directory. This directory is the repository. It will contain all the version history and allow you to access a file at any stage in its development. Generally, you will not touch this sub-directory directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can also create a repository from a pre-existing directory that has already got an established file structure and files. The process is exactly the same, just change to the directory that you want to add to version control, and run git init.\nAdditionally, when you create a new project in Rstudio, you can select to initialise a new git repository. Underneath the covers, RStudio is simply invoking git init.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Repository structures\nBefore we start adding files to the new repository, you need to be aware of a few concepts.\nThere are three main structures within the repository:\n\nWorking directory\nStaging area\nCommit history\n\n\n\n\nRepository structures\n\n\nThe working directory is the usual files and sub-directories within your project directory. You add, update, rename, delete files and direcotries in this area. When you first create a file or directory within the working directory, it is not yet under version control. Such files are referred to as untracked files.\nThe staging area is a special space to which files are added when we want to put them under version control.\nAfter staging files, they are committed to the repository. Once committed, files (and directories) are under version control and are referred to as tracked files. A commit is simply a version, but you could also think of it as a transaction with the repository. Changes to committed files are monitored and new updates to files can be committed to the repository as work on the project progresses. Every time you commit files, the commit history is saved."

In contrast to the newly initialised repository as shown in Section 5.1.2 we now have the following:\n\n\n\nAdd file to working directory\n\n\nThe above is idealised. You may encounter the situation where you have many files, a number of which you have no intention of tracking under version control. You can ignore these files by creating a .gitignore file, which tells git which files it should ignore.\nCreate a new text file with the following content:\n\nlog.txt\n\nsave the file as .gitignore. Now run git status again:\n\ngit status\n## On branch main\n## \n## No commits yet\n## \n## Untracked files:\n##   (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n##  .gitignore\n##  hello.R\n##  readme.md\n## \n## nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\nand note that the log.txt file no longer registers with git."

What happens if we added a file that we did not want to add (the -f says we want to add a file that is included in the .gitignore list).\n\ngit add -f log.txt\n\nif you run git status you will see that log.txt is also staged. To remove log.txt from the staged area:\n\ngit reset log.txt\n\nNow the picture looks like this.\n\n\n\nAdd file to staging area\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Commit\nTo commit the files that have been staged:\n\ngit commit -m \"First commit\" \n## [main (root-commit) 728d107] First commit\n##  3 files changed, 15 insertions(+)\n##  create mode 100644 .gitignore\n##  create mode 100644 hello.R\n##  create mode 100644 readme.md\n\nthe -m flag provides a message that is associated with the commit. Now when we run git status we see that the repository is up to date with the working area files. We also see that the files have been removed from the staging area.\n\ngit status\n## On branch main\n## nothing to commit, working tree clean\n\n\n\n\nCommit files to history\n\n\nBut what is the weird number in the commit history? It is basically a unique hash code that identifies this specific version of the project. Note, you will have a different hash code (and that is fine)."

The simplest way to do this is with git log which will report all of the commits in reverse chronological order. You can see\n\nthat three commits have been made, all by myself with my email address listed\nthe time the commits were made and the message associated with each\nthe hash code associated with project version at each commit\n\nnote that the full hash is reported whereas previous a truncated version is shown\n\n\nThe commit followed by (HEAD -&gt; main) shows what part of the history our working directory currently reflects.\n\ngit log\n## commit 050a9d4e989313900010d19554d450e9efc9621c (HEAD -&gt; main)\n## Author: Mark &lt;mark.jones1@sydney.edu.au&gt;\n## Date:   Thu Nov 2 14:19:16 2023 +0800\n## \n##     Updated readme.md with installation instructions.\n## \n## commit 37e05b5985e455fdeb30a8c9883914750e3f9897\n## Author: Mark &lt;mark.jones1@sydney.edu.au&gt;\n## Date:   Thu Nov 2 14:18:53 2023 +0800\n## \n##     First commit of myscript.R, testing purposes only\n## \n## commit 728d107a238c12e665dd559c3db7fa9d5beeb2eb\n## Author: Mark &lt;mark.jones1@sydney.edu.au&gt;\n## Date:   Thu Nov 2 13:55:09 2023 +0800\n## \n##     First commit\n\nYou can format the logs in a variety of ways. For a more condensed view you can use the --oneline flag:\n\ngit log --oneline\n## 050a9d4 (HEAD -&gt; main) Testing still\n## 37e05b5 Test\n## 728d107 First commit\n\nIf you want the commit history for the last n commits, or between specific dates, or by author or even via searching for a specific string in the message you can run the following\n\ngit log -n 2\ngit log --after=\"2013-11-01\" --before=\"2023-10-15\"\ngit log --author=\"Mark\\|Fred\"\ngit log --grep=\"first\" -i\n\nThe first restricts to the last two commits, the second returns commits between mid Oct and the start of Nov, the second returns commits made by Mark or Fred and the third returns any commits where the word first was included in the message text (ignoring case).\nThe log command is powerful and it lets you see who updated the files, when they made the update and why they did it. Obviously, this has less utility when you are working on a repository in isolation but it still does have value (especially to your future self). For example, you might simply want to review when specific changes were made to the files or you might want to pick up some update that has been removed from the code and reintroduce it.\nWhen you are working on a repository in collaboration (see later) the value of the logs increases many fold as a way to be able to understand the evolution of the project and to work out who you need to contact if you think a problem has been introduced."
