The git, github, github cli and github pages … technologies can be daunting to set up and use. However, once you are setup properly and understand how things fit together at a high level, users can go a long way with a minimal set of commands.\nI know, it is true that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, but it probably isn’t quite as bad as complete ignorance.\nThis text - Starting up with git - aims to provide a minimal knowledge base, sufficient to get you started without having to wade through reams of documentation distributed all over the internet. It can be browsed online or downloaded as a word document for your reference.\nWhat is version control? Setting up git Time to commit: working with a local repository Push and pull: working with a remote repository Making your first repository on GitHub Day 2: Collaborating with Others\nDealing with (git) conflicts Branching for sanity Creating pull requests Collaborating with GitHub tools Day 3: Dealing with Complications\nUndoing changes Learning good repository organization principles Ignoring things (in git) Working with large files Using the README Creating GitHub templates Extending git and GitHub with other tools"

You enter in commands as text and the system will do something, e.g. delete a file.\nCLIs are software that are supplied with the operating system. Software that implements such a text interface is often called a command-line interpreter, command processor or a shell.\nNearly universally, if I use the word terminal I am referring to the operating system command line interface.\nWindows refers to its CLI as the command prompt, and in macOS we have the terminal.\nIf you do not know how to operate your operating system CLI then you need to address that.\n\nWindows\nYou can do these tutorials to familiarise yourselves:\n\nHow to use Windows 10’s Command Prompt\nLearning Windows Terminal\n\nThe following link needs admin rights (TKI people probably won’t have nor will be able to obtain these rights) and is not strictly necessary here, but it gives a lot of useful commands and an opportunity to gain a bit more familiarity with the commandline.\n\n40 Windows Commands you NEED to know\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\nHow To Use Terminal On Your Mac\nWhat Is the Mac Terminal?\nAbsolute BEGINNER Guide to the Mac OS Terminal\n\n\n\nExtra credit\n\nLearn the command line"

A repository is the mechanism that is used to implement version control by git.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe repository is implemented by a hidden directory called .git that exists within the project directory and contains all the data on the changes that have been made to the files in the project. You should never touch this directory nor its contents.\n\n\nThere are two types of repositories, local and remote.  The local repositories reside on your machine. Remote repositories are hosted by service providers, the most common being GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. We only deal with GitHub here. GitHub comes in a few varieties:\n\nGitHub Enterprise is hosted by the company called GitHub, see github.com. It is a commercial platform, but parts of it are made freely available.\nGitHub Enterprise Server is self-hosted; this is what USyd provides via https://github.sydney.edu.au/\n\nIn a nutshell, git provides a set of commands that allow you to manage the files that are retained in these local and remote repositories.\nAgain, I cannot sum it up better than Jenny, so please take the time to read it.\nExcuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?"

If you are using Linux, you probably have no need to be reading this.\n\n2.2.1 Mac OSX\nFirst, do you have git installed already? Launch the terminal app (see the pre-requisites on the landing page if you do not know how to do this). In the terminal, type:\nwhich git\nwhich should show the location of the version of git in use:\n## /opt/homebrew/bin/git\nIf you have homebrew (see below) installed, you can just type:\nbrew install git\nand git will be installed, otherwise, follow the instructions below and then come back here.\nOnce git is installed run the which git command again and then run git --version which is shown (along with the output) below:\ngit --version\n## git version 2.42.0\nIf you got here, then you have git installed. You can close down terminal, open it up again and then run the git --version command again to make certain that everything is ok.\n\n\n2.2.2 Homebrew\nIn the previous section, you can see that the path output from the which git command includes homebrew. For macOS, homebrew is a package manager. This basically just lets you install and manage packages (applications) on your mac.\nTo use homebrew, you need to install it first. To do that, go here, then follow the instructions, which amount to going to the terminal and running the commands listed below.\nPlease go and read the landing page for homebrew before you proceed any further.\nThe first command ensures that pre-requisites are met, see here:\n xcode-select --install\nif this has already been doing you will get an error, or be asked to run Software Update. Generally, you can just move on to the next command:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\ncurl is a tool for transferring data from a url. It is usually stored under /usr/bin but if you are having issues then exporting the following might assist:\nexport HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL=1\nwhich basically tells homebrew to use its own version of curl. After the above is complete, homebrew should be installed. Now you can run\nbrew install git\nto install git for you.\nFor reference, here are a minimal set of commands for using homebrew (additional information can be found in the homebrew man pages).\nBasic information on homebrew:\n# Display the version of Homebrew.\n$ brew --version\n# Print Help Information\n$ brew help\n# Print Help Info for a brew command\n$ brew help &lt;sub-command&gt;\n# Check system for potential problems.\n$ brew doctor\nKeep your homebrew applications up to date:\n# Fetch latest version of homebrew and formula\n$ brew update\n# Show formulae with an updated version available\n$ brew outdated\n# Upgrade all outdated and unpinned brews\n$ brew upgrade\n# Upgrade only the specified brew\n$ brew upgrade &lt;formula&gt;\n# Prevent the specified formulae from being upgraded\n$ brew pin &lt;formula&gt;\n# Allow the specified formulae to be upgraded.\n$ brew unpin &lt;formula&gt;\nThe core commands for managing commandline applications are:\n# List all the installed formulae.\n$ brew list\n# Display all locally available formulae for brewing.\n$ brew search\n# Perform a substring search of formulae names for brewing.\n$ brew search &lt;text&gt;\n# Display information about the formula.\n$ brew info &lt;formula&gt;\n# Install the formula.\n$ brew install &lt;formula&gt;\n# Uninstall the formula.\n$ brew uninstall &lt;formula&gt;\n# Remove older versions of installed formulae.\n$ brew cleanup\nHomebrew casks allow you to install GUI applications. Unless you are an advanced user, you will rarely need to use these, but for completeness:\n# Tap the Cask repository from Github.\n$ brew tap homebrew/cask\n# List all the installed casks .\n$ brew cask list\n# Search all known casks based on the substring text.\n$ brew search &lt;text&gt;\n# Install the given cask.\n$ brew cask install &lt;cask&gt;\n# Reinstalls the given Cask\n$ brew cask reinstall &lt;cask&gt;\n# Uninstall the given cask.\n$ brew cask uninstall &lt;cask&gt;\n\n\n2.2.3 Windows\nThe official site for the git windows binary download is https://git-scm.com/download/win.\nDownload the 64-bit standalone installer, run it, agree to the conditions and license, choose the default location.\nEnsure that the following install components are chosen:\n\nwindows explorer integration\nlarge file support\n\nand accept any other defaults.\nWith the exception of the following, for any of the other prompts, just accept the defaults.\n\nYou will need to nominate a text file editor for editing commit messages and so on. Unless, you know what you are doing, I would advise just select the Windows Notepad application, you can reconfigure this later if you want to.\nYou should select to override the default branch name as main. The reason to do this is so that git aligns with github (which uses main as its default branch).\nFor adjusting the PATH environment variable, ensure that you select Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software which is the default.\nEnsure that line ending conversion is set to Checkout as-is, commit as-is.\nFor the terminal emulator, select Use Windows default console window. This has some limitations but it is ok for an introduction.\nEnsure that Git Credential Manager Core is selected when prompted.\n\nWe will run through this install for someone in the group.\nTo keep git up to date, you will need to go to the above site and download and reinstall git.\nOpen the command prompt and type:\ngit --version\n## git version 2.42.0"

However, it is adviseable to get this working in GitHub first and then work on getting it to work in the USyd GitHub Enterprise Server.\nThe transition from the old authentication approach has (so far) proved completely seemless for macOS.

Note that only one credential help is configured in the above example.\nIn some circumstances you may need to reconfigure things. If you have to start from scratch, the following may be useful:\ngit config --local --unset credential.helper\ngit config --global --unset credential.helper\ngit config --system --unset credential.helper\nFor windows uses check the contents of the credential manager. This can be accessed via Control Panel &gt;&gt; All Control Panel Items &gt;&gt; Credential Manager or by simply typing Credential Manager in the Windows task bar.

What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS\n## ? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes\n## ? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI?

On macOS, you can set this up easily with the following entries in the .profile shell initialisation script (or .bash_profile for those inclined).\ngh-ent() {\n  export GH_HOST=github.sydney.edu.au\n}\n\ngh-std() {\n  export GH_HOST=github.com\n}\nOn Windows, I have no idea how you are supposed to do the above in an easy manner. You may just have to resort to running\nset GH_HOST=github.sydney.edu.au\nor\nset GH_HOST=github.com\neach time you want to switch.\nNow (on macOS) when you want to interrogate github.com repositories use:\ngh-std\ngh repo list\n\n## Showing 30 of 185 repositories in @maj-biostat\n## \n## maj-biostat/misc-notes                         info for manjaro/arch linux setup                                public         1d\n## maj-biostat/wisca_2                            Revised approach to antibiogram                                  private        25d\n## maj-biostat/motc.run                                                                                            private        Sep 11, 2023\n## maj-biostat/motc.sim                           Simulation for motivate c trial                                  private        Sep 11, 2023\n## maj-biostat/motc.stan                          Stan models for motc                                             private        Sep  7, 2023\n## maj-biostat/quarto_demos_basic                 Demo using Quarto to render to word documents with custom te...  private        Aug 23, 2023\n## maj-biostat/BayesDRM                           Dose response models in stan                                     public         May 21, 2023\n## maj-biostat/motc.modproto                                                                                       public         May  1, 2023\nand for the USyd Enterprise GitHub Server, use:\ngh-ent\ngh repo list\n\nShowing 12 of 12 repositories in @mjon7053\n\nmjon7053/motc-mgt            Monitoring statistics for Motivate-C study                       private  1d\nmjon7053/fluvid.analyses     Analyses for fluvid coadministration study (COVID19 + FLU) vacc  private  17d\nmjon7053/motc.sap                                                                             public   Sep 14, 2023\nmjon7053/motc-sim-report     Motivate-C simulation report                                     private  Sep 12, 2023\nmjon7053/roadmap-notes       Notes relating to the ROADMAP project.                           private  Sep  2, 2023\nmjon7053/mjon7053.github.io                                                                   private  Aug 27, 2023"

The point of this is to give you a chance to get to grips with the basic ideas. After the main concepts are bedded in, we will move to thinking about github, which is a whole new beast.\n\nAside.\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/career-karma-tutorials/ck-git gh repo create my-newrepo –public –source=. –remote=upstream –push\nThe first part of the one liner: gh repo create my-newrepo creates and names a repo in your account (note: ‘my-newrepo’ should be replaced by the repo name of your choice) The -public flag makes sure the repo is public (swap this for -private if necessary) The -source=. flag specifies the source directory to be pushed Finally, the -remote=upstream flag specifies the remote repository to which the local repository is going to be compared with when pushing i.e the ‘upstream’ default."
