    "text": "Introduction\nThe topic of version control is quite broad and ranging. Additionally, the git, github, github cli and github pages etc version control technologies can be daunting for newcomers to set up and apply. However, once you have things installed (and configured) and you have a basic grip on how it all fits together at a high level, then you can go a long way with some introductory knowledge.\nI know, it is true that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, but it probably isn’t quite as bad as complete ignorance.\nThis text, Get going with git, aims to provide introductory knowledge that is sufficient to get you up and running with git as a means for version control. The primary focus is on the core sets of functionality.\nThe text can be browsed online or downloaded as a word document for your reference and will be used as a companion for a training workshop."

You are likely1 going to find some2 of this text hard and/or frustrating and/or/also painful.\nYour knowledge will progress in a stepwise fashion3 through setup, core concepts and collaboration. Each of these will give you pain, but once you have practice them, they will become an intuitive, integrated and a comforting safety net.\n\n\nThe approach I have taken is purposefully (and unapologetically) applied and a fairly low level perspective on git. The rationale stems from experience of this being the best way to build a clear and coherent understanding. Once you have the fundamentals practiced, it is much easier to pick up any git client of your choosing (from the long list of clients) safe in the knowledge that you have some insight into what is going on under the hood and that if things do go horribly wrong (as they invariably do) you have some chance of being able to fix them.\nThe goal here is for you to gain understanding into the fundamental aspects of revision control and git in particular. Once you have that base, extending from there will be much easier for you.\nThe pace of the workshop will be based on the abilities of the audience but there is an expectation that the audience practices the skills in their own time. The workshop is likely to be run over a few sessions but the exact length is yet to be determined. It is mainly targeted at analysts that are new to revision control but with some effort is accessible to anyone."

    "text": "Command line interfaces\nA command line interface (CLI) is a piece of software, supplied with the operating system, that you use to interact with your operating system via your keyboard rather than a mouse. Software that implements such a text interface is often called a command-line interpreter, command processor or a shell. You enter in commands as text and the system will do something, e.g. create a file, delete a file. Each of these commands is a piece of software that performs some function. git is one such command that facilitates access to a wide range of functions.\nPeople outside of software development and (some) analysts find the command line esoteric and redundant. They are wrong on both counts. At one stage, the CLI was the only way to interact with a computer. The approach provides an extremely useful set of tools that pay dividends if you make the effort to learn even a small set of them.\nNearly universally, if I use the word terminal or shell I am referring to the operating system command line interface. Windows refers to its CLI as the command prompt, and in macOS they use terminal. For the purposes here, you can treat all these terms as synonomous.\nIf you do not know how to operate your operating system CLI then you need to address that to make the most out of this text.\n\nWhy command line?\nBecause every other approach fundamentally rests on the git functionality that is exposed through the command line. While other approaches might abstract away from some of gits complexity, they also make some of the workings opaque. By learning the commandline functions, you focus on what you actually need and when you use another approach, you will understand what it is trying to achieve.\n\n\nWindows\nYou can do these tutorials to familiarise yourselves:\n\nOld, but with applicable coverage of the basics - Windows Command Line Tutorials\nLinkedIn course - Learning Windows Terminal\n\nPlease do at least one of the above.\n\n\nmacOS\n\nHow To Use Terminal On Your Mac\nWhat Is the Mac Terminal?\nAbsolute BEGINNER Guide to the Mac OS Terminal\n\n\n\nExtra credit\n\nLearn the command line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe reason I haven’t mentioned Linux is simply because for Linux oriented people, it is reasonable to assume that this level of competence has already been met."

    "text": "1.1 The big picture\nBefore we do any setup, let’s start with a big-picture. Version control is any practice that allows you to track and manage the evolution of a project.\nRemember filenames like document_v3.docx, document_v3_20230101.docx, document_v3_20230101_ts.docx? That is a manual, informal and unstructure approached to version control. You can tighten up the filenaming standards, but this approach is still very limited. For example, the approach is case by case, simultaneous changes and merges are tedious, can involve double handling and are error prone.\nA software implementation of revision control is a mechanism to understand a project/file history without having to used N^q distinct filenames to identify the different versions. Git is one of many revision control systems. In data science, IT and tech fields, it is the de-facto standard. If you ever aspire to working in a technical role in one of those fields, you would need to learn git.\nIrrespective, arguably, if you are collaborating, you should probably be using git.\nWhen you get going with git you will need to think in terms of repositories, not to be confused with suppositories. Repositories are where you project code is held.\ngit is by design a distributed system, but do not worry about that right now. Basically, there are two types of repository - local and remote. The local ones are those that reside on your own machine. The remotes ones are off in the void somewhere, but they can be linked and interact via git like this:\n\n\n\nBig picture\n\n\nRemote repositories are hosted by service providers, the most common being GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. We only deal with GitHub here. GitHub comes in a few varieties:\n\nGitHub Enterprise is hosted by the company called GitHub, see github.com. It is a commercial platform, but parts of it are made freely available.\nGitHub Enterprise Server is self-hosted; this is what USyd provides via https://github.sydney.edu.au/\n\nIn a nutshell, git provides a set of commands that allow you to manage the files that are retained in these local and remote repositories.\nAgain, I cannot sum it up better than Jenny, so please take the time to read it.\nExcuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?"

If you are using Linux, you probably have no need to be reading this.\n\n2.2.1 Mac OSX\nFirst, do you have git installed already? Launch the terminal app (see the pre-requisites on the landing page if you do not know how to do this). In the terminal, type:\n\nwhich git\n\nwhich should show the location of the version of git in use. For me, its:\n\n## /opt/homebrew/bin/git\n\nIf you have homebrew (see Section 2.2.2 below) installed, you can just type:\n\nbrew install git\n\nand git will be installed, otherwise, follow the instructions below and then come back here.\nOnce git is installed run the which git command again and then run git --version which is shown (along with the output) below:\n\ngit --version\n## git version 2.42.0\n\nIf you got here, then you have git installed. You can close down terminal, open it up again and then run the git --version command again to make certain that everything is ok.\n\n\n2.2.2 Homebrew\nIn the previous section, you can see that the path output from the which git command includes homebrew. For macOS, homebrew is a package manager. This basically just lets you install and manage packages (applications) on your mac.\nTo use homebrew, you need to install it first. To do that, go here, then follow the instructions, which amount to going to the terminal and running the commands listed below.\nPlease go and read the landing page for homebrew before you proceed any further.\nThe first command ensures that pre-requisites are met, see here:\n\n xcode-select --install\n\nif this has already been done you will get an error, or be asked to run Software Update. Generally, you can just move on to the next command:\n\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\ncurl is a tool for transferring data from a url. It is usually stored under /usr/bin but if you are having issues then exporting the following might assist:\n\nexport HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL=1\n\nwhich basically tells homebrew to use its own version of curl. After the above is complete, homebrew should be installed. Now you can run\n\nbrew install git\n\nto install git for you.\nFor reference, here are a minimal set of commands for using homebrew (additional information can be found in the homebrew man pages).\nBasic information on homebrew:\n\n# Display the version of Homebrew.\n$ brew --version\n# Print Help Information\n$ brew help\n# Print Help Info for a brew command\n$ brew help &lt;sub-command&gt;\n# Check system for potential problems.\n$ brew doctor\n\nKeep your homebrew applications up to date:\n\n# Fetch latest version of homebrew and formula\n$ brew update\n# Show formulae with an updated version available\n$ brew outdated\n# Upgrade all outdated and unpinned brews\n$ brew upgrade\n# Upgrade only the specified brew\n$ brew upgrade &lt;formula&gt;\n# Prevent the specified formulae from being upgraded\n$ brew pin &lt;formula&gt;\n# Allow the specified formulae to be upgraded.\n$ brew unpin &lt;formula&gt;\n\nThe core commands for managing commandline applications are:\n\n# List all the installed formulae.\n$ brew list\n# Display all locally available formulae for brewing.\n$ brew search\n# Perform a substring search of formulae names for brewing.\n$ brew search &lt;text&gt;\n# Display information about the formula.\n$ brew info &lt;formula&gt;\n# Install the formula.\n$ brew install &lt;formula&gt;\n# Uninstall the formula.\n$ brew uninstall &lt;formula&gt;\n# Remove older versions of installed formulae.\n$ brew cleanup\n\nHomebrew casks allow you to install GUI applications. Unless you are an advanced user, you will rarely need to use these, but for completeness:\n\n# Tap the Cask repository from GitHub\n$ brew tap homebrew/cask\n# List all the installed casks .\n$ brew cask list\n# Search all known casks based on the substring text.\n$ brew search &lt;text&gt;\n# Install the given cask.\n$ brew cask install &lt;cask&gt;\n# Reinstalls the given Cask\n$ brew cask reinstall &lt;cask&gt;\n# Uninstall the given cask.\n$ brew cask uninstall &lt;cask&gt;\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Windows\nThe official site for the git windows binary download is https://git-scm.com/download/win.\nIf you haven’t done all the install steps, download the 64-bit standalone installer, run it, agree to the conditions and license, choose the default location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere might be some merit in re-installing git just to make sure you have the latest version and that you select the correct setup.\n\n\nEnsure that the following install components are chosen:\n\nwindows explorer integration\nlarge file support\n\nand accept any other defaults.\nWith the exception of the following, for any of the other prompts, just accept the defaults.\n\nYou will need to nominate a text file editor for editing commit messages and so on. Unless, you know what you are doing, I would advise just select the Windows Notepad application, you can reconfigure this later if you want to.\nYou should select to override the default branch name as main. The reason to do this is so that git aligns with GitHub (which uses main as its default branch).\nFor adjusting the PATH environment variable, ensure that you select Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software which is the default.\nEnsure that line ending conversion is set to Checkout as-is, commit as-is.\nFor the terminal emulator, select Use Windows default console window. This has some limitations but it is ok for an introduction. That said, if you are comfortable with the bash variant, do not let me stand in your way.\nEnsure that Git Credential Manager Core is selected when prompted.\n\nWe will run through this install for someone in the group.\nTo keep git up to date, you will need to go to the above site and download and reinstall git.\nOpen the command prompt and type:\n\ngit --version\n## git version 2.42.0"

This has obvious benefits if we want to be able to figure out who has done what, when and why.\nAnother tweak we will make is to the default branch name. Git always used to call this master by default. GitHub, in its infinite wisdom, appeared to make some judgement on the connotations of that default name and so changed it to main.

That is, if you want to avoid having to enter your user name and token for every transaction you have with your GitHub repository, which is something you want to avoid. There is another alternative and that is to keep your credentials in a plain text file, but again that is strongly discouraged.\nEnter the Git Credential Manager (GCM).\nThe GCM is a platform agnostic credential manager (in English, that translates loosely to a password manager). Once it’s installed and configured, the Git Credential Manager is called by git and your interactions with GitHub become much more seamless.\nThe next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires authentication, Git will prompt you to log in using a browser window. You may first be asked to authorize an OAuth app. If your account or organization requires two-factor auth, you’ll also need to complete the 2FA challenge.\nOnce you’ve authenticated successfully, your credentials are stored in the macOS keychain (or Windows equivalent) and will be used every time you clone an HTTPS URL. From there on in, git should not require you to type your credentials in the command line again (unless you change your credentials).\n\n4.2.1 GCM install\nFor Windows users it can be installed by selecting this option during the installation wizard, see Section 2.2.3, step 6. To display the current version, one of the following should help depending on which version of git you have:\n\ngit credential-manager version\n\n\ngit credential-manager-core --version\n\nFor macOS, use homebrew again, specifically:\n\nbrew install --cask git-credential-manager\n## ==&gt; Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask.jws.json\n## ############################################################################################################################################## 100.0%\n## ==&gt; Downloading https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/releases/download/v2.3.2/gcm-osx-arm64-2.3.2.pkg\n## ==&gt; Downloading from https://objects.githubusercontent.com/github-production-release-asset-2e65be/158405551/3b89ee5f-5275-4316-a794-6f39e38849c4?X-Am\n## ############################################################################################################################################## 100.0%\n## ==&gt; Installing Cask git-credential-manager\n## ==&gt; Running installer for git-credential-manager with sudo; the password may be necessary.\n## Password:\n## installer: Package name is Git Credential Manager\n## installer: Installing at base path /\n## installer: The install was successful.\n## 🍺  git-credential-manager was successfully installed!\n\nand then type:\n\ngit-credential-manager --version\n\nto confirm it was installed and is accessible.\n\n\n4.2.2 GCM demo\nBelow I demo the process by cloning a private repository from my GitHub account.

Note that only one of the git config commands returns a credential helper in the above example.\n\n\nIn some circumstances you may need to reconfigure things. If you have to start from scratch, the following may be useful:\n\ngit config --local --unset credential.helper\ngit config --global --unset credential.helper\ngit config --system --unset credential.helper\n\nFor windows uses check the contents of the credential manager. I believe that this can be accessed via Control Panel &gt;&gt; All Control Panel Items &gt;&gt; Credential Manager or by simply typing Credential Manager in the Windows task bar.

You can think of it as an extension of git that allows you to invoke the GitHub specific functionality.\nThe extremely terse gh CLI manual can be found here.\nFor Windows users, you can pick up the latest Signed MSI executables from the release page.\nFor macOS, use homebrew:\n\nbrew install gh\n## ==&gt; Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula.jws.json\n## #################################################################################################################################### 100.0%\n## ==&gt; Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask.jws.json\n## #################################################################################################################################### 100.0%\n## ==&gt; Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/gh/manifests/2.37.0\n## Already downloaded: /Users/mark/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/331c0b76fd34aa97342efa0e4e41373dbac71c28aeb49346b1284b3450f4105b--gh-2.37.0.bottle_manifest.json\n## ==&gt; Fetching gh\n## ==&gt; Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/gh/blobs/sha256:a8c21e08d77963c2d12102aefe38f8c010c573b771ccf729ea438c40dddb7f3a\n## Already downloaded: /Users/mark/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/d0e6a3f8f7a4b138b36484ec9ec8aff26b499381a0b4459f53efc0aefe001ee2--gh--2.37.0.arm64_ventura.bottle.tar.gz\n## ==&gt; Pouring gh--2.37.0.arm64_ventura.bottle.tar.gz\n## ==&gt; Caveats\n## Bash completion has been installed to:\n##   /opt/homebrew/etc/bash_completion.d\n## ==&gt; Summary\n## 🍺  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gh/2.37.0: 191 files, 44.2MB\n## ==&gt; Running `brew cleanup gh`...\n## Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.\n## Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).\n\n\n4.3.1 GitHub CLI authentication\nIn order to make use of gh we need to go through another round of authentication setup. To do this, go to the terminal and run:\n\ngh auth login\n## ? What account do you want to log into? GitHub Enterprise Server\n## ? GHE hostname: github.sydney.edu.au\n## ? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS\n## ? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes\n## ? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser\n\nFor additional information, see gh auth –help.\nIn order to use gh with github.com directly you need to authenticate for that platform too. Repeat the above, but now the responses look like this:\n\ngh auth login\n## ? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com\n## ? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS\n## ? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes\n## ? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser\n\nYou are nearly set. You can verify that what you have configured worked via:\n\ngh auth status\n## github.sydney.edu.au\n##   ✓ Logged in to github.sydney.edu.au as mjon7053 (keyring)\n##   ✓ Git operations for github.sydney.edu.au configured to use https protocol.\n##   ✓ Token: gho_************************************\n##   ✓ Token scopes: gist, read:org, repo, workflow\n## \n## github.com\n##   ✓ Logged in to github.com as maj-biostat (keyring)\n##   ✓ Git operations for github.com configured to use https protocol.\n##   ✓ Token: gho_************************************\n##   ✓ Token scopes: gist, read:org, repo, workflow\n\nHowever, for gh to work with the desired host you need to set an environment variable to tell gh which platform to use. On macOS, you can set this up easily with the following entries in the .profile shell initialisation script (or .bash_profile for those inclined).\n\ngh-ent() {\n  export GH_HOST=github.sydney.edu.au\n}\n\ngh-std() {\n  export GH_HOST=github.com\n}\n\nOn Windows, I have no idea how you are supposed to do the above in an easy manner. You may just have to resort to running\n\nset GH_HOST=github.sydney.edu.au\n\nor\n\nset GH_HOST=github.com\n\neach time you want to switch.\nNow (on macOS) when you want to interrogate github.com repositories we can use the following commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDo not worry about the meaning of the commands, this is just to establish that we have configured things correctly.\n\n\n\ngh-std\ngh repo list\n\n## Showing 30 of 185 repositories in @maj-biostat\n## \n## maj-biostat/misc-notes                         info for manjaro/arch linux setup                                public         1d\n## maj-biostat/wisca_2                            Revised approach to antibiogram                                  private        25d\n## maj-biostat/motc.run                                                                                            private        Sep 11, 2023\n## maj-biostat/motc.sim                           Simulation for motivate c trial                                  private        Sep 11, 2023\n## maj-biostat/motc.stan                          Stan models for motc                                             private        Sep  7, 2023\n## maj-biostat/quarto_demos_basic                 Demo using Quarto to render to word documents with custom te...  private        Aug 23, 2023\n## maj-biostat/BayesDRM                           Dose response models in stan                                     public         May 21, 2023\n## maj-biostat/motc.modproto                                                                                       public         May  1, 2023\n\nand for the USyd Enterprise GitHub Server, use:\n\ngh-ent\ngh repo list\n\n## Showing 12 of 12 repositories in @mjon7053\n## \n## mjon7053/motc-mgt            Monitoring statistics for Motivate-C study                       private  1d\n## mjon7053/fluvid.analyses     Analyses for fluvid coadministration study (COVID19 + FLU) vacc  private  17d\n## mjon7053/motc.sap                                                                             public   Sep ## 14, 2023\n## mjon7053/motc-sim-report     Motivate-C simulation report                                     private  Sep ## 12, 2023\n## mjon7053/roadmap-notes       Notes relating to the ROADMAP project.                           private  Sep ##  2, 2023\n## mjon7053/mjon7053.github.io                                                                   private  Aug 27, 2023"

    "section": "5.1 Git repositories",
    "text": "5.1 Git repositories\nA repository is the most basic component of git. It is where the history is retained in terms of commits (it’s not correct but for the time being you can think of these as versions or snapshots of the files/repository).\nRepositories can be public or private, can involve single people or multiple collaborators and can be stored locally (on your personal computer), be located/stored in the cloud (in the cloud as in hosted by a service provider like GitHub), or on a physical server (a basic file server will suffice in most cases), or just on your local machine.\nUsing the functions provided through git, you can create and configure repositories, add or remove files, review history of the files in the repository and much more.\n\n5.1.1 Initialisation\nLet’s initialise a new repository. Run the following on your machine:\n\n# Change dir to the local workshop directory, \n# e.g. cd ~/Documents/get-going-with-git\nmkdir first-repo\n\ncd first-repo\n\ngit init\n## Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/mark/Documents/project/misc-stats/first-repo/.git/\ngit status\n## On branch main\n## \n## No commits yet\n## \n## nothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe repository is implemented by a hidden directory called .git that exists within the project directory and contains all the data on the changes that have been made to the files in the project. You should never touch this directory nor its contents.\n\n\nIf you received the output detailed above (or something very similar to it) then congratulations, you initialised a git repository.\nIf you have configured your file explorer to show hidden files, you will notice that the first-repo directory now contains a .git sub-directory. If you are running Windows, then depending on what version you have, you may be able to run ls -la or dir /a to list all files (i.e. including hidden files) within a directory.\nAgain, the .git directory contains everything related to the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you delete the .git directory, you will erase all of your commits. So, do not delete it unless you are absolutely certain this is what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nYou can also create a repository from a pre-existing directory that has already got an established file structure and files. The process is exactly the same, just change to the directory that you want to add to version control, and run git init.\nWhen you create a new project in Rstudio, you can select to initialise a new git repository. Underneath the covers, RStudio is simply invoking git init.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Repository structures\nBefore we start adding files to the new repository, you need to be aware of a few concepts.\nThere are three main structures within the context of a repository:\n\nWorking directory\nStaging area\nCommit history\n\n\n\n\nRepository structures\n\n\n\n5.1.2.1 Working directory\nIs the usual files and sub-directories within your project directory. You introduce, update, rename, delete files and direcotries in this area and they form your project (an analysis, a set of documentation etc). When you first create a file or directory within the working directory, it is not yet under version control. Such files are referred to as untracked files.\n\n\n5.1.2.2 Staging area\nIs a special space to where you stage (aka list or identify) the files that are to be committed as a new version under version control.\n\n\n5.1.2.3 Commit history\nAfter staging files, they are committed to the repository. Once committed, files (and directories) are under version control and are referred to as tracked files. A commit is simply a version, but you could also think of it as a transaction with the repository if it helps your mental model. Changes to committed files are monitored and new updates to files can be committed to the repository as work on the project progresses. Every time you commit files, the commit history is saved."

In contrast to the newly initialised repository as shown in Section 5.1.2 we now have the following:\n\n\n\nAdd file to working directory\n\n\nThe above is idealised. You may encounter the situation where you have many files, a number of which you have no intention of tracking under version control. You can ignore these files by creating a .gitignore file, which tells git which files it should ignore.\nCreate a new text file with the following content and save the file as .gitignore. This is a special configuration filename that git recognises. The . at the front of gitignore is important.\nIf you missed the . or mistakenly added a .txt extension then the .gitignore functionality will not work.\n\n# .gitignore file contains files\n# that the repository will ignore\nlog.txt\n*.txt\n\nIf you list (ls -la) the files in the first-repo directory, you should see the following (or something very similar):\n\n192-168-1-100:first-repo mark$ ls -la\ntotal 32\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 mark  staff  224  7 Nov 10:15 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 mark  staff  256  7 Nov 10:12 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  9 mark  staff  288  7 Nov 10:15 .git\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 mark  staff   81  7 Nov 10:15 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 mark  staff  126  7 Nov 10:13 hello.R\n-rw-r--r--  1 mark  staff    4  7 Nov 10:14 log.txt\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 mark  staff   59  7 Nov 10:13 readme.md\n\nRun git status again and note that the log.txt file no longer registers with git.\n\ngit status\n## On branch main\n## \n## No commits yet\n## \n## Untracked files:\n##   (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n##  .gitignore\n##  hello.R\n##  readme.md\n## \n## nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)"

It is a unique hash code that identifies this specific version of the project.

    "text": "6.4 Tracking commit history\nOne of the most notable features of revision control is that you can review your project file history. The simplest way to do this is with git log which will report all of the commits in reverse chronological order. You can see\n\nwho made the commits\nwhen they were made and why (the commit messages)\nthe hash code associated with project version at each commit\n\nnote that the full hash is reported whereas previous a truncated version is shown\n\n\nThe commit followed by (HEAD -&gt; main) shows what part of the history our working directory currently reflects.\nHere is an example (your repository will look different but that is ok)\n\ngit log\n\n## commit 327170a6bc4d39463c4cfbc0f257420496642cb5 (HEAD -&gt; main)\n## Author: Mark &lt;mark.jones1@sydney.edu.au&gt;\n## Date:   Tue Nov 7 10:25:23 2023 +0800\n## \n##     Minor edit\n## \n## commit b078716e80498c2fa7abfb8ae27b204b2dc603d8\n## Author: Mark &lt;mark.jones1@sydney.edu.au&gt;\n## Date:   Tue Nov 7 10:24:58 2023 +0800\n## \n##     New file\n## \n## commit 0cd2d52e989059a61315525a3488e06d22cd04a5\n## Author: Mark &lt;mark.jones1@sydney.edu.au&gt;\n## Date:   Tue Nov 7 10:23:23 2023 +0800\n## \n##     First commit\n\nYou can format the logs in a variety of ways. For a more condensed view you can use the --oneline flag:\n\ngit log --oneline\n## 327170a (HEAD -&gt; main) Minor edit\n## b078716 New file\n## 0cd2d52 First commit\n\nIf you want the commit history for the last n commits, or between specific dates, or by author or even via searching for a specific string in the message you can run the following\n\ngit log -n 2\ngit log --after=\"2013-11-01\" --before=\"2023-10-15\"\ngit log --author=\"Mark\\|Fred\"\ngit log --grep=\"first\" -i\n\nTry them.\nThe first restricts to the last two commits, the second returns commits between mid Oct and the start of Nov, the second returns commits made by Mark or Fred and the third returns any commits where the word first was included in the message text (ignoring case).\nThe log command is powerful and it lets you see who updated the files, when they made the update and why they did it. Obviously, this has less utility when you are working on a repository in isolation but it still does have value (especially to your future self). For example, you might simply want to review when specific changes were made to the files or you might want to pick up some update that has been removed from the code and reintroduce it.\nWhen you are working on a repository in collaboration (see later) the value of the logs increases many fold as a way to be able to understand the evolution of the project and to work out who you need to contact if you think a problem has been introduced.\nA particularly useful log command is, which gives you a visual depiction of the repository structure. Here is an example from a small repo that we will look at later.\n\ngit log --oneline --graph --all\n\n*   a904f44 (HEAD -&gt; main, origin/main) Merge branch 'feat001'\n|\\\n| *   9c949d0 (feat001) Resolved merge conflict by retaining majbiostat implementation.\n| |\\\n| |/\n|/|\n* | 14b1c35 Csum implementation\n* | cc35ec0 Readme for landing page\n| * c615c0c Implementation of cumsum alias\n|/\n* 8e9007a Initiall commit\n\nTo establish what files were included in any given commit, you can use git show:\n\ngit show --name-only 0cd2d52\n## Author: Mark &lt;mark.jones1@sydney.edu.au&gt;\n## Date:   Tue Nov 7 10:23:23 2023 +0800\n## \n##     First commit\n## \n## .gitignore\n## hello.R\n## readme.md"

    "text": "8.1 What is a branch?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTime to step it up a notch. With branching, practice and repitition is key to understanding. Try not to panic.\n\n\nBranching is a mechanism that allows you to undertake work independently from the main (or base) content of a project while allowing you to keep in sync and also giving you the option of bringing your work back into the main content. The process allows multiple pieces of work by multiple people to be progressed independently within the same project. You might diverge because you have want to take the project in a new direction altogether or because you are working on a bug that is going to break things more before the fix is realised. Ideally, the work on your branch will be homogenous - it will, more or less, relate to one thing, one feature, one bug etc.\nWhen you run git status you saw the text - On branch main as part of the output.\n\npwd\n# /Users/mark/Documents/project/misc-stats/first-repo\ngit status\n## On branch main\n## Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n## \n## nothing to commit, working tree clean\n\nThere are a range of strategies for the way that a group uses branching, but for our purposes, you can think of main as your default branch.\nSimilarly, when you ran git log the current commit reported is suffixed with (HEAD -&gt; main). Both of these were a reference to the version on the branch that is currently linked to the working directory. It is where you presently are in the commit history.\n\ngit log --oneline\n## 516ad1a (HEAD -&gt; main, tag: v4.0, origin/main, rm, analysis-04) Code review comments\n## a286918 Analysis 4\n## 538330d Merge remote-tracking branch 'refs/remotes/origin/main'\n## 49c68c2 Mark has also added detail to the readme.md\n## 3a3dd8d Testing Sylvie\n## 2829471 Merge branch 'analysis-03'\n## be09457 (tag: v3.0, analysis-03) Finished surv\n## 53115b6 minor\n\nFor example, initially there is a singular progression of the project, but at some point you will want to create a release for a software product, or a piece of documentation or an analysis. Later you may want to revise the release due to changes in project direction, new data, bugs etc. You use branches to facilitate this process in a logical and coherent way. Typically, you branch off from the default branch of a repository, but you can branch from any branch that exists.\nIn the examples encountered so far, the branching we have encountered is just a stem (specifically, the main branch). Below is a common type of representation of the kind of branch that we have dealth with so far.\nThe circles represent each commit, which would refer to changes in one or more files. The repository has gone through a series of commits (1, 2, 3, 4 etc.) and the working directory is currently looking at the repository version 4.\n\n\n\nBranch more like a stem\n\n\nThe arrow pointing at 4 is the current HEAD of the repository. HEAD is a special concept in git. It answers the question “What am I currently looking at?”"

When you move to a new branch, the HEAD reference is updated to point to the branch that you switched to.\nGo to the Chapter 14 resources page and save the branching.R file to your first-repo directory.\nThe file contains the following:\n\n\nCode\n# R script to demo branching\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(data.table))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(survival))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(rtables))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))\n\nmessage(\"-------------------------------\")\nmessage(\"NOW WE WILL MOVE ONTO BRUNCHING\\n\")\nmessage(\"-------------------------------\")\n\n\n# Data generation  ------------------\nset.seed(1)\n\nN &lt;- 4000\nd &lt;- data.table(\n  id = 1:N,\n  u = rbinom(N, 1, 0.5)\n)\n\nd[u == 0, x := rbinom(.N, 1, 0.2)]\nd[u == 1, x := rbinom(.N, 1, 0.8)]\n\nb0 &lt;- 3\nb1 &lt;- 1\nb2 &lt;- -2\nb3 &lt;- -1\ne &lt;- 1\nw_cens &lt;- 4\n\n# Continuous outcome\nd[, mu := b0 + b1 * x + b2 * u + b3 * x * u]\nd[, y := rnorm(.N, mu, 1)]\n\n# Binary outcome\nd[x == 1, z := rbinom(.N, 1, 0.7)]\nd[x == 0, z := rbinom(.N, 1, 0.3)]\n\n# Survival outcome\n# Median tte -log(0.5)/0.6 vs -log(0.5)\nd[x == 1, w := rexp(.N, 0.6)]\nd[x == 0, w := rexp(.N, 1.0)]\nd[, evt := as.integer(w &lt; w_cens)]\nd[evt == 0, w := w_cens]\n\n# Labels\nd[x == 0, arm := \"FBI\"]\nd[x == 1, arm := \"ACTIVE\"]\n\nd[u == 0, age := \"&lt; 50 years\"]\nd[u == 1, age := \"&gt;= 50 years\"]\n\n# Descriptive summary -------\n\nmessage(\"\\nDESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY:\\n\")\n\nlyt &lt;- basic_table() %&gt;%\n  split_cols_by(\"arm\") %&gt;%\n  summarize_row_groups() %&gt;%\n  analyze(\"y\", mean, format = \"xx.x\")\n\nbuild_table(lyt, d)\n\n# Analyses --------\n\nmessage(\"\\n\\nANALYSIS OF CONTINOUS OUTCOME (UNSTRATIFIED):\\n\")\n\nlm1 &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data = d)\nsummary(lm1)\n\n\nRun the script:\n\nRscript branching.R\n\nImagine this was the first analysis for a project and will be sent to the clients. The completed work represents a milestone for the project so we stage and commit the file and then create a tag for it.\n\ngit tag -a v1.0 -m \"Analysis 1\"\n\nWe continue with the work for the next deliverable completing a secondary analysis on the binary outcome z. Add the following code to the end of the branching.R script, re-run with Rscript branching.R and then commit the file to the repository.\n\nmessage(\"\\n\\nANALYSIS OF BINARY OUTCOME (UNSTRATIFIED):\\n\")\n\nlm2 &lt;- glm(z ~ x, data = d, family = binomial)\nsummary(lm2)\n\npr &lt;- predict(lm2, newdata = data.table(x = 0:1), type = \"response\", se = T)\nd_fit &lt;- data.table(\n  arm = c(\"PBO\", \"ACTIVE\"),\n  x = 0:1,\n  pr_z = pr$fit,\n  pr_z_lb = pr$fit - 2 * pr$se.fit,\n  pr_z_ub = pr$fit + 2 * pr$se.fit\n)\n\nWe are not finished with our second deliverable, but at this point we realise that the initial analysis that was sent to the client was incorrect. As you may have spotted, we should have run a stratified analysis due to the presence of a confounder. We urgently need to re-issue the corrected analysis to the client. Bummer.\nIn contrast to the minor change above, in real life we might be much further along with this next deliverable, which may be vastly more complex than what I have illustrated above. For example, we may have introduced new files, restructured the original analysis, added functionality etc.\nWhile we could go through the process of winding back all the changes, with revision control we do not have to because we can rewind to any point. We’ll go over one approach to this using git. It isn’t the ideal process to tackle the problem1 but it was chosen to highlight a few points.\n\n8.2.1 Commit\nFirst thing to do is to check that your code is running ok and then commit any files that have not yet been committed to the repository. Not doing so will cause you some major headaches, so best advice is to not forget to do this.\n\ngit status\ngit add braching.R\ngit commit -m \"Commit of files part way through development\"\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Rewind\nWe can rewind the state of our working directory to the time at which the deliverable was made. We do this by first using git log to find the commit hash or we can just use the tag that we set for the release. Using the tag is more convenient so let’s do that.\n\ngit log --oneline\ngit checkout v1.0\n## Note: switching to 'v1.0'.\n## \n## You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental\n## changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\n## state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.\n## \n## If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\n## do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:\n## \n##   git switch -c &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\n## \n## Or undo this operation with:\n## \n##   git switch -\n## \n## Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false\n## \n## HEAD is now at a2cc6f7 Comments from code review\n\nIn terms of the schematic of the repository, the environment now looks like this.\n\n\n\nRewind to earlier deliverable\n\n\nWe have move the HEAD such that our working versions now point to the files that were originally delivered to the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon’t panic overly about the warning about being in the detached HEAD state.\nWhat it means is that you are no longer on a branch. You have checked out a single commit in the history.\n\n\nIf you look at branching.R you will see that the starts of the secondary analysis has disappeared.\n\n\n8.2.3 Fix issue\nIn order to fix the analysis we need to introduce the confounder as a covariate in the linear model. Introduce the following fixes. First to the descriptive summary:\n\nmessage(\"\\nDESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY:\\n\")\n\nlyt &lt;- basic_table() %&gt;%\n  split_cols_by(\"arm\") %&gt;%\n  split_rows_by(\"age\") %&gt;%\n  summarize_row_groups() %&gt;%\n  analyze(\"y\", mean, format = \"xx.x\")\n\nbuild_table(lyt, d)\n\nand then to the analysis make these corrections and finally re-run the script to confirm that it produces what we expect.\n\nlm1 &lt;- lm(y ~ x * u, data = d)\nsummary(lm1)\n\nStage and then commit these changes. We can get some insight into the state of the tree now. Below I have added one more commit so that you can get a sense of how things are progressing.\n\ngit log --oneline --decorate --graph --all\n## * 7ab12b3 (HEAD) Code review correction\n## * 4cca810 Added emergency fix\n## | * c82a48d (main) Started on secondary analyses\n## |/\n## * a2cc6f7 (tag: v1.0) Comments from code review\n## * fa24778 branching.R\n## * 3bdac46 Revised approach to capturing input\n## * 327170a Minor edit\n## * b078716 New file\n## * 0cd2d52 First commit\n\nThe equivalent illustration would look something like this:\n\n\n\nAdd a fix\n\n\n\n\n8.2.4 Make permanent\nNow that we have fixed the code, we want to make the change permanent. That is, we want to formally tell git that our alternative history should be maintained. The way to do that is to create a new branch out of the recent changes (which already look like a branch).\nArguably, it would probably have been better to do this first given that we had to make the change. On the other hand, if we were just experimenting, then perhaps there was never any intention to make the change permanent and a new branch would not be required.\n\ngit branch fix-01\n# Switch to new branch\ngit checkout fix-01\n\nWhen we look at the tree we see both HEAD and the branch (note the first line text which says HEAD, fix-01).\n\ngit log --oneline --decorate --graph --all\n## * 7ab12b3 (HEAD, fix-01) Code review correction\n## * 4cca810 Added emergency fix\n## | * c82a48d (main) Started on secondary analyses\n## |/\n## * a2cc6f7 (tag: v1.0) Comments from code review\n## * fa24778 branching.R\n## * 3bdac46 Revised approach to capturing input\n## * 327170a Minor edit\n## * b078716 New file\n## * 0cd2d52 First commit\n\nAnd now the picture is\n\n\n\nLooking at the HEAD of our new branch\n\n\nIf this is the version that we re-issue to the client, we might as well tag it.\n\ngit tag -a v1.1 -m \"Analysis 1 (re-issue)\"\n\n\n\n8.2.5 Switching back to the secondary\nSwitching back to our partially complete secondary analysis is simple:\n\ngit checkout main\n\nIf you look at the branching.R script you will be able to see the secondary analysis we started some time ago. That is, if you look closely, you will see that the changes we just made in the fix-01 branch have not yet been propagated to the main branch. It is important that we pick up this fix.\nThis process is known as merging and it will be tackled shortly.\n\n\n8.2.6 Clean up\nWhen you are done with a branch as in you have finished all the work, merged (see next) and released, you might want to remove the branch.\nYou can do this with\n\ngit branch -d &lt;branch name&gt;\n\nnoting that you can use a capital -D to force the delete irrespective of the merge status (unsafe)."

    "text": "10.1 No GitHub?\nGitHub is a hosting service for git repositories. It also extends some of the git functionality. They have captured the market.\nBefore 2005 (ish), GitHub did not exist, and it wasn’t a catastrophe. What did we do? Git has the functionality built into it to allow collaboration via hosting git repositories directly on fileservers. This is a reasonable solution for small teams with access to a common network, but it has its limits and you are probably not going to go down this path unless the infrastructure is formally managed by your IT support. Nevertheless, most bluechip organisations used this approach during the 2000’s.\nRepositories that are retained outside of your local machine are referred to as remotes. It doesn’t matter whether they are hosted on LIQ, or a random file server or GitHub or BitBucket or Timbuktu. They are still known as remotes.\nRemotes allow you to work on a repository collaboratively with your colleagues. This has been standard practice in software development since about 300 B.C.\nWe will talk about hosting remotes on fileservers here and then move on to GitHub next."

I will refer to this location as Sylvie’s repo vs Mark’s repo which is the one that I have been referencing when demonstrating examples.\nIn contrast to the bare repository remote, Sylvie now has the example files that we have been developing to date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that I called the repo sylvie-first-repo.

On the right we have Mark who created the remote from his local repository and Sylvie who cloned the remote repository to her local machine. Git isn’t restricted to this centralised architecture (it is possible to have multiple remotes and other variations) but it is a common paradigm.\nGitHub uses a different workflow that commonly (though not exclusively) relies on a project owner pulling a developers updates into a main project repository rather than the developer pushing their work directly to the project repository. We will see more about this later."

    "text": "10.4 Keeping remotes up to date\nFor now, you can think of a remote as the hub around which collaboration revolves. As a project progresses, the local files are updated and we need to get these updates to the remote. However, others may beat us to the post in this process and thus we may be out of sync with the remote.\nAgain, this would mean that the state of the remote is ahead of your local repository.\nIn this scenario, git (and GitHub) will not allow you to send your updates to the repository unless you are sync’d. In other words, you have to be up to date in order to send your changes to the remote.\nTo be able to push your work up to the remote, the steps are:\n\nensure that all your changes are committed to the local repository\nrun git fetch to bring down the latest changes from the remote\nif necessary, merge any changes into your local repository to get up to date\nensure (again) that all your changes are committed to the local repository\ngit push you modifications up to the remote\n\nHere is another picture.\n\n\n\nCentralised workflow\n\n\nIt sounds (and looks) a bit involved, but in practice it is simple. We will go over the steps below.\n\n10.4.1 Fetch and push (simple case)\nFirst Silvie ensures that all her local changes are committed to the repository. It looks like Silvie made a change to the readme.md when we were not looking.\n\ncd sylvie-first-repo\ngit status\n## On branch main\n## Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n## \n## Changes not staged for commit:\n##   (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n##   (use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n##  modified:   readme.md\n## \n## no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\ngit add readme.md; git commit -m \"Minor change for testing fetch\"\n\nNo changes have been made to the remote by anyone else (Silvie has not pushed her changes) so when we run git fetch there are no updates to be had. Therefore we can go and push the changes.\n\ngit push\n## Enumerating objects: 5, done.\n## Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.\n## Delta compression using up to 8 threads\n## Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\n## Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 342 bytes | 342.00 KiB/s, done.\n## Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n## To /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Staff)/first-repo.git\n##    7eee4b5..49225cc  main -&gt; main\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe examples under the git push man page are helpful and informative for further detail on the interpretation of git push.\n\n\nLooking at the logs we see the following\n\ngit log --oneline\n## 3a3dd8d (HEAD -&gt; main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) Testing Sylvie\n## 2829471 Merge branch 'analysis-03'\n## be09457 (tag: v3.0, origin/analysis-03) Finished surv\n## 53115b6 minor\n## 7a5e7b9 Surv analysis\n## 1a9dfeb (tag: v2.0) Edits from code review\n## d1586df Completion of secondary analysis\n## bf34b9c Merge from fix-01\n## b8de16c (tag: v1.1, origin/fix-01) Edits from code review\n## 12561d9 Emergency fix\n## d88f9e5 WIP\n## a2cc6f7 (tag: v1.0) Comments from code review\n## fa24778 branching.R\n## 3bdac46 Revised approach to capturing input\n## 327170a Minor edit\n## b078716 New file\n## 0cd2d52 First commit\n\n\n\n10.4.2 Fetch and push (merge required)\nIn the interim Mark has been working on the first-repo and will want to get these changes into the remote. However, Mark hasn’t yet linked his local repository with the remote.\n\ngit remote -v\n## nothing\n\nTo fix this we use git remote add which, predictably tells git to configure a link between a local and remote version of the repository. This is a one time process and once we have set the remote, we do not need to do it again until we need to add a new remote.\n\ngit remote add origin /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney\\(Staff\\)/first-repo.git\ngit remote -v\n## origin   /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Staff)/first-repo.git (fetch)\n## origin   /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Staff)/first-repo.git (push)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe use of the word origin below is just convention to indicate the primary remote. It is a shortcut for the full directory path (or URL) for the remote. You can call the remote anything you want but most people stick with the convention of origin, which is a bit like the GitHub convention of using main for the main branch. If you were to add a second remote, you would call it something other than origin.\n\n\nNext, we need to tell the local repository to reference this remote.\n\ngit remote add origin /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney\\(Staff\\)/first-repo.git\ngit remote -v\n## origin   /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Staff)/first-repo.git (fetch)\n## origin   /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Staff)/first-repo.git (push)\n\nWe see that the remote has been added for both push and fetch. Before we use these, we need to make an existing local branch track a specific remote branch which is achieved with\n\ngit fetch  # pulls down information on the branches in the remote\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main # links a local with remote branch\n\nChecking the status we see that the change that Sylvie pushed has left us out of sync.\n\ngit status\n## On branch main\n## Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,\n## and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.\n##   (use \"git pull\" if you want to integrate the remote branch with yours)\n## \n## nothing to commit, working tree clean\n\nIf I try to push my change anyway, git barfs:\n\ngit push\n## To /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Staff)/first-repo.git\n##  ! [rejected]        main -&gt; main (non-fast-forward)\n## error: failed to push some refs to '/Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Staff)/first-repo.git'\n## hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind\n## hint: its remote counterpart. If you want to integrate the remote changes,\n## hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.\n## hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\n\nThis is what I was referring to earlier. Git will not allow you to screw up the remote without some strenous effort on your part. It would be nice if git had told us what was different, but it forces us to do this via the following:\n\ngit fetch # this was done previously, but just to be clear that you need to do a fetch first\ngit diff main origin/main\n## diff --git a/readme.md b/readme.md\n## index 0165627..797358c 100644\n## --- a/readme.md\n## +++ b/readme.md\n## @@ -4,7 +4,9 @@ A demo markdown file for the git workshop.\n## \n##  A new line for testing.\n## \n## -Contains standalone R scripts for staged deliverables to client.\n## +Contains standalone R scripts.\n## +\n## +Test by Sylvie\n\nYou can see the line that I introduced and also the change that Sylvie added and committed to the remote. There are a few options to resolve this. Most people use git pull which runs the two steps as one. I prefer to be explicit and feel like it might be a bit safer to split the process up into a fetch and then a merge, although I think I am in the minority.\n\ngit fetch\ngit merge\n## Auto-merging readme.md\n## Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.\n##  readme.md | 3 +++\n##  1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit offers another command git pull that effectively combines git fetch with git merge. The benefit of using git fetch is that it will update your local repository but will not make any changes to your working directory (see Section 5.1.2.1 for a reminder).\n\n\nAnd in this case, the merge appears to have worked correctly.\n\n# first-repo\n\nA demo markdown file for the git workshop.\n\nA new line for testing.\n\nContains standalone R scripts for staged deliverables to client.\n\nTest by Sylvie"

    "text": "11.2 Common functions via GitHub\nSome1 of the functionality that git implements has been integrated into the GitHub platform. Let’s go over some of them briefly.\n\n11.2.1 Initialise repository\nThere are a few ways to do this. The simplest is to initialise the repo on GitHub then clone it down to your machine. The preferred way to to start with pre-existing local work (repo) and connect it with a remote on GitHub.\n\n11.2.1.1 Initialise on GitHub\nYou can achieve this directly from any page.\n\n\n\nGitHub initialise new remote repository\n\n\nThe configuration is largely self-explanatory.\n\n\n\nConfigure the repository\n\n\nAnd then you are taken to your new shiny repository page.\n\n\n\nNew repository page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe easiest (but not necessarily the best) way to collaborate via GitHub is to add collaborators to your repository. By adding collaborators, you are giving people read/write access to your repository. It is therefore your responsibility to make sure you are confident that they know what they are doing.\nThe topic of pull requests (see later) introduce a mechanism that in part mitigates the risks associated with collaborative repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborators setting\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter collaborator details\n\n\nAnd if you want to change the visibility (public/private) of the repository, the functions to do this are down at the bottom of general settings under the Dange Zone section.\n\n\n11.2.1.2 Initialise from existing repository\nAgain, you can achieve this directly from any page.\n\n\n\nGitHub initialise new remote repository\n\n\nThe only difference in the setup is that you do NOT to initialize the repository with a readme. You will then be shown the following instructions. The latter case is the one that is applicable, as shown.\n\n\n\nLink a local repo with the new remote\n\n\nIf you recall from the previous discussion on fileserver remotes, we had set the remote for the first-repo repository to be a OneDrive remote. Recapping:\n\npwd\n## /Users/mark/Documents/project/misc-stats/first-repo\ngit remote -v\n## origin   /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Staff)/first-repo.git (fetch)\n## origin   /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Staff)/first-repo.git (push)\n\nWhile we can technically have multiple remotes, it might be easier to simply unlink from this current remote.\n\ngit remote rm origin\ngit remote -v\n## \n\nAnd now add GitHub as the new remote.\n\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/maj-biostat/demo2.git\ngit branch -M main\ngit push -u origin main\n\n## Enumerating objects: 68, done.\n## Counting objects: 100% (68/68), done.\n## Delta compression using up to 8 threads\n## Compressing objects: 100% (67/67), done.\n## Writing objects: 100% (68/68), 6.51 KiB | 3.25 MiB/s, done.\n## Total 68 (delta 41), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n## remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (41/41), done.\n## To https://github.com/maj-biostat/demo2.git\n##  * [new branch]      main -&gt; main\n## branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe git branch -M main simply renames the current branch to main. In practice, this isn’t a problem if you create all of your repositories with a default branch called main instead of master which is the legacy git preferred name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe git push -u pushes up the branch information and the evolution of the repository. The -u is bsically telling git to link your local main branch with the remote main branch. You only need to use this flag once and thereafter you can use git fetch and git push and git will know which remote you want to communicate with.\n\n\nWhen we refresh the github page https://github.com/maj-biostat/demo-02 (replacing my username with your own) then we see that the first-repo now appears on GitHub. It doesn’t matter that the remote repo is called something other than first-repo. Generally you will give things the same names, but not always.\n\n\n\nfirst-repo is now on GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Clone a GitHub remote\nIn the first approach to initialising a remote (Section 11.2.1.1) we did not bring the remote down to the local machine. However, this is fairly trivial process to achieve by using git clone in a similar manner to how we used it previously.\nNavigate back to the demo-01 repository on GitHub, select the green clone button and copy the link to your clipboard.\n\n\n\nCloning from GitHub\n\n\nNow head back to your terminal, change directory out of first-repo into the local workshop directory and run the following which clones the demo-01 repository to a local directory named demo-01.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLocally, you can give the remote repository any name you want. Here we have just used the same repository name as the remote, but we could call it my-demo-01 or anything else you want.\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/maj-biostat/demo-01.git demo-01\n## Cloning into 'demo-01'...\n## remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.\n## remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.\n## remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n## Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.\ncd demo-01/\nls -la\n## total 8\n## drwxr-xr-x  10 mark  staff  320  9 Nov 13:29 ..\n## drwxr-xr-x   4 mark  staff  128  9 Nov 13:29 .\n## -rw-r--r--   1 mark  staff   24  9 Nov 13:29 README.md\n## drwxr-xr-x  12 mark  staff  384  9 Nov 13:29 .git\n\n\n\n11.2.3 Fetch and push\nOnce you have linked your local and remote repositories, the workflow is identical to what has been previously introduced.\nLet’s work through the process again.\nFollowing best practice, prior to making a change we create a feature branch and then switch to that branch.\n\ngit branch dev-01\ngit checkout dev-01\n## Switched to branch 'dev-01'\n\nRather than code something up, simply download the random-numbers.R script (also listed on resources, Chapter 14 page) and save it to the demo-01 repository folder on your machine. Run the script with Rscript random-numbers.R to make sure that it works.\n\nRscript random-numbers.R\n##         categorical      normal     gamma poisson\n## Min.             -3 -3.56987408 0.0329983    3.00\n## 1st Qu.          -2 -0.56524365 0.2845135    8.00\n## Median            0  0.03029335 0.7235894    9.00\n## Mean              0  0.07900788 1.0749329    9.82\n## 3rd Qu.           2  0.74139889 1.3816200   12.00\n## Max.              3  3.18586281 5.3176913   20.00\n\nNow make an arbitrary change to the README.md file then stage and commit the files to the dev-01 branch.\n\ngit status\n## On branch dev-01\n## Changes not staged for commit:\n##   (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n##   (use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n##  modified:   README.md\n## \n## Untracked files:\n##   (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n##  random-numbers.R\ngit add README.md random-numbers.R\ngit status\n## On branch dev-01\n## Changes to be committed:\n##   (use \"git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n##  modified:   README.md\n##  new file:   random-numbers.R\ngit commit -m \"Development for demo-01 project\"\n## [dev-01 fc5f874] Development for demo-01 project\n## 2 files changed, 12 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\nSwitch back to the main branch and get ready to merge your piece of work into the local main branch2.\n\ngit checkout main\n\nLooking at the logs, you can see the dev-01 branch is one step ahead of what we are currently viewing in our working directory.\n\ngit log --oneline --decorate --graph --all\n## * fc5f874 (dev-01) Development for demo-01 project\n## * 809fe51 (HEAD -&gt; main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) Initial commit\n\nand the working directory reflects this reality as only the READ.md file currently exists.\n\nls -la\n## total 8\n## drwxr-xr-x   4 mark  staff  128 10 Nov 11:44 .\n## drwxr-xr-x  10 mark  staff  320 10 Nov 09:19 ..\n## drwxr-xr-x  13 mark  staff  416 10 Nov 11:44 .git\n## -rw-r--r--   1 mark  staff   26 10 Nov 11:44 README.md\n\nMerge the dev-01 branch into main\n\ngit merge dev-01\n## Updating 809fe51..fc5f874\n## Fast-forward\n##  README.md        |  2 +-\n##  random-numbers.R | 11 +++++++++++\n##  2 files changed, 12 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)\n##  create mode 100644 random-numbers.R\n\nWe now have all the files and updates:\n\nls -la\n## total 16\n## drwxr-xr-x   5 mark  staff  160 10 Nov 11:49 .\n## drwxr-xr-x  10 mark  staff  320 10 Nov 09:19 ..\n## drwxr-xr-x  14 mark  staff  448 10 Nov 11:49 .git\n## -rw-r--r--   1 mark  staff   66 10 Nov 11:49 README.md\n## -rw-r--r--   1 mark  staff  203 10 Nov 11:49 random-numbers.R\n\nAnd the logs indicate that we are now up to date (note the location of HEAD)\n\ngit log --oneline --decorate --graph --all\n## * fc5f874 (HEAD -&gt; main, dev-01) Development for demo-01 project\n## * 809fe51 (origin/main, origin/HEAD) Initial commit\n\nIn this case, we know there have been no changes to the remote during the time where we were doing our development. However, in most collaborative projects, you cannot guarantee this, so we would run a git fetch followed by a git merge to merge any changes that had been pushed to the remote by our collaborators. Finally, we push our updates to the remote, remembering to use the -u flag on this first occasion.\n\ngit push -u origin main\n## Enumerating objects: 6, done.\n## Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.\n## Delta compression using up to 8 threads\n## Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.\n## Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 513 bytes | 513.00 KiB/s, done.\n## Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n## To https://github.com/maj-biostat/demo-01.git\n##    809fe51..fc5f874  main -&gt; main\n## branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you wish to push all branches (i.e. both main and dev-01) in this case then you would need to add the --all flag to the git push. In the present example, this would push all the branches up to the remote. All people reviewing the remote can then review the complete history should they need to.\n\n\n\ngit push --all\n## Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n## remote:\n## remote: Create a pull request for 'dev-01' on GitHub by visiting:\n## remote:      https://github.com/maj-biostat/demo-01/pull/new/dev-01\n## remote:\n## To https://github.com/maj-biostat/demo-01.git\n##  * [new branch]      dev-01 -&gt; dev-01\n\nAnd the change can be observed once the GitHub page is refreshed.\n\n\n\nUpdated files pushed to GitHub\n\n\n\n\n11.2.4 Reviewing history\nGitHub provides an interface to review the changes that have occurred on the repo. Clicking on a file within your repository will take you to the file history page where you can review the evolution of the file.\n\n\n\nUpdated readme and pushed to GitHub\n\n\nOnce the history page opens you can navigate to various versions of a file. One the left you can select the branch of interest (here main is shown). You can view the code or the commit with syntax highlighting or in raw form (which also lets you copy and paste the raw text should you need it). Over on the right are the latest commit point and an open to review the full timeline (History).\n\n\n\nFile review\n\n\nWhen you review the blame view, you can see determine who did what and when.\n\n\n\nCode associated with commits\n\n\n\n\n11.2.5 Issues\nIssues can be managed directly within GitHub, although they are repository specific. Currently, our team mostly uses Jira to track and manage issues and therefore I will not cover the GitHub functionality beyond mentioning that it is very straight forward to use.\nOne instance where you may be required to use GitHub issue functionality is when you find a bug in a CRAN package, e.g. https://github.com/rstudio/gt/issues/1415. When doing so, you will find that they require a particular protocol to be followed that include the development of a minimal working example. This is standard practice in software development, it makes a developers life much easier and it is more likely that the problem you are reporting will actually get fixed."
